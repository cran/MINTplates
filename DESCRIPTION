Version: 1.0.0
Authors@R: person("Shanliang","Zhong",email="slzhong@foxmail.com",role=c("aut","cre"))
Description: It can be used to create/encode molecular "license-plates" from sequences and to also decode the "license-plates" back to sequences.  While initially created for transfer RNA-derived small fragments, this tool can be used for any genomic sequences including but not limited to: transfer RNA-derived small fragments, microRNAs, etc. The detailed information can reference to the Pliatsika V, Loher P, Telonis AG, Rigoutsos I (2016) <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btw194>.
